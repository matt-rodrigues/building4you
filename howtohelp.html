                    <br>
                    <p> you can help our NGO in several meaningful ways. Your contribution is essential for us to
                        continue providing vital support to the LGBTQAPN+ community.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> one way to contribute is through financial donations. you can make a donation directly to our
                        IBAN: IE29AIBK93115212345678. these donations enable us to expand our services and
                        reach more people in need, ensuring that each individual receives the support they deserve.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>in addition to financial donations, you can also make a difference by dedicating your time and
                        skills as a volunteer. we need volunteers to assist in various areas, such as:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>theater and painting classes: help inspire and develop the creativity of
                        our participants, providing them with a form of personal expression and strengthening their
                        self-esteem.</p>
                    <p>maintenance of building spaces: collaborate in maintaining and improving
                        our spaces, ensuring a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.</p>
                    <p>welcoming new people: be a friendly and welcoming presence for those who
                        come seeking help, helping them feel valued and welcome.</p>
                    <p>listening to those in need: offer a friendly ear and attentive listening to
                        those who need to vent and share their experiences.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>your support, whether through financial donations or volunteer work, is essential for us to
                        continue our mission of inclusion and support for the LGBTQAPN+ community. together, we can
                        build a more
                        just
                        and welcoming future for everyone.</p>
