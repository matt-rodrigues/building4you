# building4u

building4u is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the LGBTQAPN+ community, offering a variety of essential services in a safe and inclusive environment. Our mission is to provide comprehensive care, including rapid HIV and STI testing, psychological counseling, and classes such as yoga and theater. We believe that well-being extends beyond physical health, so we strive to promote the emotional and social well-being of every individual who comes to our organization.

With a team of trained and compassionate professionals, we aim to ensure that each person is treated with dignity and respect. Additionally, our supportive community provides a welcoming space where everyone is valued and accepted. Through our ongoing efforts, we are committed to building a world where diversity is celebrated and where everyone has the freedom to live authentically. Join us as we work to create a brighter and more inclusive future for all, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.

I chose to use exclusively lowercase letters throughout the site to improve accessibility and readability, especially for people with dyslexia. Studies show that lowercase letters have more consistent and distinct shapes, making it easier to identify and quickly read words, reducing visual confusion and common reading errors among dyslexic individuals. This design choice aims to create a more inclusive and user-friendly digital environment for all users.

### Imagery

### Features 

The website consists of five pages, with four of them accessible through the navigation menu: the home page, the about building4u page, the services page, and the contact us page. The fifth page is a thank you page that appears after a user submits the form on the contact us page.

### Accessibility

I have been attentive to make the website as accessible-friendly as possible through the following measures:

* Utilizing semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and enhance accessibility.
* Incorporating descriptive alt attributes for images on the site to provide alternative text for screen readers.
* Ensuring an adequate color contrast across the site to improve readability for users with visual impairments.
* Making menus accessible by indicating the current page as "current" for screen readers, aiding navigation and orientation.

By implementing these considerations, I have strived to enhance the overall accessibility of the website.
